# WebGPU Port - WebGPU bindings for Emscripten

This is an implementation of WebGPU bindings for Emscripten.

This package provides the legacy (old) webgpu.h header used by Emscripten, and
a copy of the current standard (new) webgpu.h provided by emdawnwgpu.

This package optionally provides Wagyu extensions to the WebGPU API, which
are available from the webgpu_wagyu.h header. These extensions are not part of
the WebGPU standard, and are specific to Wagyu use cases.

## Usage

You can either use this as an Emscripten "port" or as a "remote port". They are
essentially the same thing, but a remote port downloads and provides the actual
port indirectly.

To use the remote port file, pass it as an option like this to your
emscripten build commands:
```
--use-port=[your_path]/webgpu-remoteport.py
```

You can also directly use the local port file `webgpu-port.py` from the
webgpu-port repository (or a copy of it).
```
--use-port=[your_path]/webgpu-port.py
```

## Configuration

You can configure the port by passing options to `--use-port` as key=value
pairs delimited by colons.

For example:

```
--use-port=webgpu-remoteport.py:wagyu=true
```

Supported options:

- `wagyu`:

    Controls whether Wagyu extensions should be used.

    true to enable, false to disable (default is false).
